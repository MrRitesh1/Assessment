What are controlled components ?

In React, Controlled Components are those in which form’s data is 
handled by the component’s state. It takes its current value through 
props and makes changes through callbacks like onClick,onChange, etc. 
A parent component manages its own state and passes the new values as 
props to the controlled component.

In the form elements are either the typed ones like textarea. 
input or the selected one like radio buttons or checkboxes, whenever 
there is any change, made it is updated accordingly through some functions 
that update the state as well.
