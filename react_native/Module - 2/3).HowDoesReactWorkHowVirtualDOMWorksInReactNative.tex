How does React work?

React Native uses native Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to render mobile UI 
components in Objective-C (iOS) or Java (Android). Because of that, developers 
can create platform-specific components and share the source code across multiple platforms.

How Virtual-DOM works in React Native?

To understand the virtual DOM strategy, we need to understand the two major 
phases that are involved, rendering and reconciliation.

When we render an application user interface, 
React creates a virtual DOM tree representing that UI and stores it in memory. 
On the next update, or in other words, when the data that renders the app changes, 
React will automatically create a new virtual DOM tree for the update.
