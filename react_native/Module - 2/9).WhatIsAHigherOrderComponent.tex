What is a higher order component? 

A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in 
React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. 
They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.

Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a 
component and returns a new component.

const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order 
component transforms a component into another component.

HOCs are common in third-party React libraries, such as 
Redux’s connect and Relay’s createFragmentContainer.

In this document, we’ll discuss why higher-order components are useful, 
and how to write your own.
