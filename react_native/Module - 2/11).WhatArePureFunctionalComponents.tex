What are pure functional Components?

Functional components are very useful in React, especially when 
you want to isolate state management from the component. 
That’s why they are often called stateless components.

However, functional components cannot leverage the performance 
improvements and render optimizations that come with React.
PureComponent since by definition, they are not classes.

If you want React to treat a functional component as a 
pure component, you’ll have to convert the functional component 
to a class component that extends React.PureComponent.


// FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT

function PercentageStat({ label, score = 0, total = Math.max(1, score) }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h6>{ label }</h6>
      <span>{ Math.round(score / total * 100) }%</span>
    </div>
  )
}


// CONVERTED TO PURE COMPONENT

class PercentageStat extends React.PureComponent {

  render() {
    const { label, score = 0, total = Math.max(1, score) } = this.props;

    return (
      <div>
        <h6>{ label }</h6>
        <span>{ Math.round(score / total * 100) }%</span>
      </div>
    )
  }
