What is a pure component in React?
Based on the concept of purity in functional programming paradigms, 
a function is said to be pure if it meets the following two conditions:

Its return value is only determined by its input values
Its return value is always the same for the same input values
A React component is considered pure if it renders the same output for 
the same state and props. For this type of class component, React provides 
the PureComponent base class. Class components that extend the React.PureComponent 
class are treated as pure components.

Pure components have some performance improvements and render 
optimizations since React implements the shouldComponentUpdate() method for them 
with a shallow comparison for props and state.

How does a pure component work in React?
In practice, a React pure component looks like the following code:

import React from 'react';

class PercentageStat extends React.PureComponent {

  render() {
    const { label, score = 0, total = Math.max(1, score) } = this.props;

    return (
      <div>
        <h6>{ label }</h6>
        <span>{ Math.round(score / total * 100) }</span>
      </div>
    )
  }

}

export default PercentageStat;
