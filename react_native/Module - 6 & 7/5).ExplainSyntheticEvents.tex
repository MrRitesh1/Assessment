Explain Synthetic Events ?

Overview
Your event handlers will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, a 
cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. 
It has the same interface as the browser’s native event, 
including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events 
work identically across all browsers.

If you find that you need the underlying browser event for 
some reason, simply use the nativeEvent attribute to get it. 
The synthetic events are different from, and do not map directly 
to, the browser’s native events. For example in onMouseLeave event.
nativeEvent will point to a mouseout event. The specific mapping is 
not part of the public API and may change at any time.
