What is Flux?
Flux is a Javascript architecture or pattern for UI which runs on a 
unidirectional data flow and has a centralized dispatcher. It is useful 
when your project has dynamic data and you need to keep the data updated 
in an effective manner. It was created by Facebook, and complements React 
as view. This model is used to ease maintenance. It has three primary components: 
Views, Stores, and Dispatcher. As the MVC application grows, we find many 
numbers of views as models, which are all talking to each other, making it 
difficult to manage and debug
