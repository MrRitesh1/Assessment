=> What is Redux Thunk used for?

Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to return functions, 
rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows for delayed actions, 
including working with promises.  One of the main use cases for this 
middleware is for handling actions that might not be synchronous, 
for example, using axios to send a GET request. Redux Thunk allows us 
to dispatch those actions asynchronously and resolve each promise that gets returned.

Installation and Setup

npm install redux-thunk --save 
yarn add redux-thunk

and what is its purpose?

The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState is a callback 
function which gets called immediately after the setState is completed and the 
components get re-rendered.

If you want your program to update the value of a state using setState and then 
perform certain actions on the updated value of state then you must specify those 
actions in a function which should be the second argument of the setState. If we 
would not do so then those actions will be performed on the previous value of state 
because of asynchronous nature of setState.
